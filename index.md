# Richard Pearsall  
**Cloud Engineering | Automation | Linux | Infrastructure-as-Code**

I design and build reproducible, automated infrastructure using Linux, Docker, Ansible, and Proxmox.  
My homelab is a fully documented, modular environment that mirrors real-world cloud engineering practices:  
network segmentation, reverse proxies, monitoring, backups, automation, and declarative configuration.

This site showcases my architecture, projects, and documentation.

## 🔧 Core Competencies
- Linux systems engineering  
- Infrastructure-as-Code (Ansible, Terraform)  
- Containerization (Docker)  
- Virtualization (Proxmox/KVM)  
- Monitoring & observability (Prometheus, Grafana, Dozzle)  
- Backup & disaster recovery (Restic, PBS)  
- Secure networking & zero-trust access (Cloudflared, Crowdsec, Cloudflare-Bouncer)
